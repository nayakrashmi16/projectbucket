Projects that I've worked on during the past 3 years.

1. Smart India Hackathon 2017 - Finalist
As per our problem statement for the SIH 2017, we created a web-based application which was used to facilitate passengers within Airport premises.
It involved Indoor Map navigation to navigate passengers to various locations within the Airport like Terminals, Boarding Gates or Amenities like Restaurants, Shops, Restrooms etc.
The application also showed the status of various flights, both arriving and departing with a feature to perform web check-in. The details of various Amenities like location, offers, items sold etc. were also displayed to the user. As part of further improvements, we hope to include user-choice recommendedation system for Shopping, Offers in various stores etc.

2. IoT Project on Automation in Small scale Milk and Cold Storage Industries
(i) To monitor and rectify temperature and Pressure in Homogenisers. 
Pressure and Temperature play a vital role in Homogenisation of milk. Any deviations from optimum temperature and pressure affects the process. The existing system required manual monitoring. We used IoT based solution to automate this process by incorporating a temperature sensor and viscometer to monitor these parameters. Any deviation from optimum benchmarks are relayed to the system, and sounds an alarm for rectification.
(ii) To maintain optimal temperatures in Cold Storage Systems.
Cold Storages are used to store Volumes of milk and milk products either in warehouses or for transsportation. Temperature fluctutation lead to spoilage and wastage of product. Frequent opening and closing, or improper closing of door increases the temperature of the storage. We use a temperature sensor to monitor temperature and relay it to systems. Any increase in temperature over long periods of time is detected and rectified.
Technology Stack:
IoT Coomponents: Temperature sensor, Ethernet Card or Wifi module, Viscometer.
Progamming: C/C++

3. IoT powered Solar power Vehicle - Aditi Tejomaya
An interdisciplinary project with the Mechanical department, we automated a Solar Powered 3 wheeler vehicle with GPS tracking, RFID authorisation, a battery level indicator and an Android application to faciliatate the users of the vehicle with details about it.
The GPS tracker tracks the vehicle in real-time relaying the location back to the application. The RFID authorisation incorporates RFID tag into ID cards to ensure only Authorised users can access the vehicle. The battery meter monitors the remaining battery power.
Technology Stack: 
IoT Components: GPS tracker, GSM module, RFID card and scanner, Battery level indicator
Android application

4. Ruby on rails based Dashboard for Monitoring Company Process
As part of an Internship at Sri Krishna Itech, developed a ruby on rails Dashboard which monitors their company processes. Involves a Signup and Login for Admins, Dashboard to view status of various processes and operators at various levels, Report generation using Excel sheet.
Technology Stack:
Ruby on Rails framework for front and backend.
Database: MySQL

5. Machine Learning based Evolutionary Algorithmic Path finder
Used Genetic Algorithms to simulate the Biological Phenomenon of Natural Selection, Mutation, Crossover. A set of rockets from an initial random population learn to find their way to a target over many generations, learning from their previous experiences. The track has multiple obstacles that the rockets have to avoid in order to reach the target. After each generation, rockets with the best fitness are chosen and added to mating pool. Over multiple generations, the rockets eventually "learn" to avoid the obstacles and reach the target. Fitness is calculated as the measure of how close a rocket reached to the target. Mutation is introduced to avoid getting stuck at a local maxima.

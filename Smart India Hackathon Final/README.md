# AirTrack - Smart India Hackathon 2017

The project is aimed at developing an indoor navigation system for airports in our country. Additionally, airport amenities such as restaurants, lounges, shops etc were required to be interfaced for the user via the application.

The project was implemented as a web-based application to enable platform independency.
The application has used Google Maps API to recreate the indoor mapping of the airport and guide the user. The customised indoor maps was plotted with My Maps. The PNR information are entered in by the user, and his respective flight timings are logged. The application then alerts the user of his respective departure terminal and could navigate him/her to the gate upon request.
The application also hosts the various retails, lounges and amenities available in the airport, their products and offers are also displayed. The user could navigate to them as well. Various other feaures like timely alerts, customer discounts and offers have been implemented too.

Firebase DB was used to hold the various information for its realtime features and flexibilty.
